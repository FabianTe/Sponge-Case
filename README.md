This is both a Go module and a command line tool converts strings into "Sponge Case".

I actually don't know if it is called like that but suit yourself ðŸ˜‰

This tool will convert strings like this ...

```text
This will definitely build my reputation as a software developer
```

into this ...

```text
THIs Will Definitely bUIld mY RepUTaTiOn AS a soFtWaRe deVelOPER
```

## Installation
