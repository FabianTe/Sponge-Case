I actually don't know if it is called like that but suit yourself ðŸ˜‰

This tool will convert strings like this ...

```text
This will definitely build my reputation as a software developer
```

... into this

```text
THIs Will Definitely bUIld mY RepUTaTiOn AS a soFtWaRe deVelOPER
```

## Installation

You can either download prebuild executables from the [Releases tab](https://github.com/FabianTe/spongecase/releases).

## Usage

#### CLI - Piping string into STDIN

```shell script
echo "This will definitely build my reputation as a software developer" | spongecase
```

#### CLI - Passing string as argument

```shell script
spongecase "This will definitely build my reputation as a software developer"
```

#### Importing as Go module

```shell script
go get github.com/FabianTe/spongecase
```

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"github.com/FabianTe/spongecase"
	"math/rand"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	rand.Seed(time.Now().UTC().UnixNano())
	fmt.Println(spongecase.ApplyStr("This will definitely build my reputation as a software developer"))
}
```

*Hint: if you want different/random results (similar to the behavior of the command line version), you need to set a seed with `rand.Seed` first (as shown in the example).*
